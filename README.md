get_data
========

DRS4 Eval Board data acquisition tool

Installation
------------

CMake is required to build the program!

Type the following on the command line (from the get_data source directory)

  mkdir build
  cd build
  cmake ..
  make
  sudo make install

You should now be able to call get_data from the command line and use it :)
